### Refining the Wealth Index developed by The DHS Program.

The DHS program in collaboration with other organisations conducts the National Family and Household survery, once every 10 years in India. One of the uses of this survey is to develop a wealth index to understand the unique problems faced by different sections of the society. In my first project, I'm going to analyse and refine the wealth index to be more accurate and representative of all kinds of demography.
